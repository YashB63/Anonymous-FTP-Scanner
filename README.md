# Anonymous-FTP-Scanner
An anonymous FTP scanner is a tool used to identify File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers that allow anonymous access. It works by sending requests to different IP addresses and ports, and then analyzing the responses to determine whether the FTP server is configured to allow anonymous access or not.
The purpose of an anonymous FTP scanner is to help identify FTP servers that may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, since anonymous access typically allows anyone to connect to the FTP server without providing any login credentials. This can be a security risk if sensitive information is stored on the FTP server.
Once an anonymous FTP server has been identified, an attacker may be able to use a variety of techniques to access and manipulate files on the server. Therefore, it is important for organizations to secure their FTP servers and ensure that anonymous access is not allowed unless it is absolutely necessary for their operations.
