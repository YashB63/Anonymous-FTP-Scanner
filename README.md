# Anonymous-FTP-Scanner
An anonymous FTP scanner is a tool used to identify File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers that allow anonymous access. It works by sending requests to different IP addresses and ports, and then analyzing the responses to determine whether the FTP server is configured to allow anonymous access or not.
